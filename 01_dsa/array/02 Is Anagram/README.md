# Is Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

_An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different._

*Example 1:*

`Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"`

`Output: true`
*Example 2:*

`Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"`

`Output: false`

*Constraints:*

s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## How to run
Run either the `is_anagram_sorted_solution.py` or `is_anagram_sorted_solution.py` files in your python environment using:
`python <filename.py>`

*Example:*
`python `is_anagram_sorted_solution.py`

## Output
Lookout for the output in your terminal, It should be thesame as in my [results.txt](https://github.com/AlphonseBrandon/interviewing/blob/main/01_dsa/array/02%20Is%20Anagram/results.txt) log file.
